# fictions-futures
Speculative bits. My/our POV, not MPOV=MPOW (there's some kind of wordplay possible here: point of view, #MPOW as Twitter shorthand for anonymizing references to My Place of Work when you have a critique that you aren't safe expressing, not My Place of Vocation [MPOV]â€“to cite Fobazi Ettarh's scholarship re:the harms of vocational awe https://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2018/vocational-awe/)
